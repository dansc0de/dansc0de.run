# Hey There, I'm Dan

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I am a software engineer, and I am creating this page for a few reasons:

1. This site is part of a larger project for a course I am teaching at the University of Pittsburgh. I am using this site to demonstrate how to host static site on GCP.
2. TBD
